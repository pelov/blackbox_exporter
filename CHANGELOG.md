## 0.19.0 / 2021-05-07

This release is built with go 1.16.4, which contains a [bugfix](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/45712)
that can cause an untrusted target to make Blackbox Exporter crash.

In the HTTP probe, `no_follow_redirect` has been changed to `follow_redirect`.
This release accepts both, with a precedence to the `no_follow_redirect` parameter.
In the next release, `no_follow_redirect` will be removed.
